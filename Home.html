	<p>Hi! I'm Michael Paul Meneses a Computer Engineering Student at Adamson University
	I grew up and was born in a bustling city, 
	where the fast-paced speed of life sparked my interest in the outside world at a young age. 
	I have a profound understanding for many viewpoints and backgrounds 
	as a result of growing up in a multicultural atmosphere. 
	My viewpoint was formed by my cosmopolitan upbringing, 
	which also encouraged a strong sense of empathy and open-mindedness 
	that I still possess now.</p>
	<p>I attended some of the best universities as part of my educational journey to hone my interest for science and technology. 
	I entered the IT world as a computer engineer, where I've had the good fortune to work on cutting-edge projects and cooperate with amazing brains. 
	The constantly changing technological world inspires me to keep learning and developing while pushing the bounds of what is possible. 
	Outside of studies, I'm a fervent explorer and nature lover who is constantly looking for new heights to scale and uncharted terrain to explore. </p>
